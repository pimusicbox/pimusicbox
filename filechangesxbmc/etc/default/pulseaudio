# Start the PulseAudio sound server in system mode.
# (enables the pulseaudio init script - requires that users be in the
# pulse-access group)
# System mode is not the recommended way to run PulseAudio as it has some
# limitations (such as no shared memory access) and could potentially allow
# users to disconnect or redirect each others' audio streams. The
# recommended way to run PulseAudio is as a per-session daemon. For GNOME/KDE/
# Xfce sessions in Ubuntu Lucid/10.04, /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop
# handles this function of automatically starting PulseAudio on login, and for
# it to work correctly your user must *not* have "autospawn = no" set in
# ~/.pulse/client.conf (or in /etc/pulse/client.conf). By default, autospawn
# is enabled. For other sessions, you can simply start PulseAudio with
# "pulseaudio --daemonize".
# 0 = don't start in system mode, 1 = start in system mode
PULSEAUDIO_SYSTEM_START=0

# Prevent users from dynamically loading modules into the PulseAudio sound
# server. Dynamic module loading enhances the flexibility of the PulseAudio
# system, but may pose a security risk.
# 0 = no, 1 = yes
