# Set the name of the MusicBox. In this way you can create different devices on the same network (in different rooms).
# The webinterface is accessible via e.g. http://kitchen.local/, and multiple devices will show up in AirTunes
# You can only use normal caracters and numbers in the name (no spaces, dots, etc)
# You can even have different devices with different Spotify accounts when needed.

# Edit this if you want to add soundcloud support. You have to get a token via http://www.mopidy.com/authenticate

# SOUNDCLOUD_TOKEN = 1-1111-1111111
# The explore option lets you define playlists to explore
# For example, if you want Smooth Jazz from https://soundcloud.com/explore/jazz%2Bblues your entry would be 'jazz%2Bblues/Smooth Jazz'

# Google Music Settings (alpha!)
# The device ID is a 16-digit hexadecimal string (without a '0x' prefix) identifying the Android device registered for Google Play Music.
# You can obtain this ID by dialing *#*#8255#*#* on your phone (see the aid) or using an app like Android Device ID (see the Google Service Framework ID Key).
# You may also leave this field empty. MusicBox will try to find the ID by itself. See the Mopidy logs for more information.
